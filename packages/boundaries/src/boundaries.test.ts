/**
 * The dependency boundaries in `.dependency-cruiser.ts`, cruised over the site workspace and proven able to fail.
 *
 * A boundary checker fails open. Every rule matches on resolved paths, so a cruise that resolves nothing satisfies all
 * of them and prints a clean run. Here that is the default rather than a risk: dependency-cruiser reads TypeScript
 * through the compiler API and supports `typescript@>=2 <7`, and the repository is on TypeScript 7, so against the
 * repository's own install it cruises zero modules and reports zero violations. The cruise therefore runs through the
 * install root at `tooling/boundaries`, which holds a TypeScript it can drive, and this suite checks the graph — a
 * module floor, a type-only edge, a resolved crossing between layers — before it believes the violation count, then
 * cruises a fixture of deliberate crossings and expects each named rule to trip.
 *
 * It is its own Vitest workspace because the site's suites run under `bun test`, and the boundary proof needs one
 * bare `vitest run` entrypoint. It cruises the site from outside that workspace, so its `turbo.json` names the site's
 * sources, the ruleset and the tooling root as inputs.
