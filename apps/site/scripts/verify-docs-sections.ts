/**
 * Verifies that a Docs section is declared, ordered, and written in the site's own voice.
 *
 * Guidance used to be a section of its own, and it read as a routing layer over
 * other repositories' work: seventy links into GitHub across thirty-five pages,
 * six of them literally `[The full guide](…/tools-ki/blob/…)`. Moving those
 * pages under the projects that own them fixed where they lived (KI-WEB-SITE-025);
 * this fixes what they say, because a page that moved and still points at a
 * README has changed its URL and nothing else.
 *
 * The pages have since moved again. A guide is not a thing a reader looks up
 * once — it is one page of a finite body of material with a beginning and an
 * end — so they now live in sections under `src/docs/` rather than beneath the
 * project each describes, and a project page links to its section rather than
 * listing its pages (KI-WEB-SITE-037). This gate moved with them, and what it
 * resolves the binding against moved too: the authority is now
 * `src/_data/docsSections.json5`, the registry the Docs landing grid is built
 * from, rather than the project registry. A section must be declared to exist
 * and must exist to be declared, in both directions, so a card cannot point at
 * an empty section and a section cannot exist without a card.
 *
 * What is checked, all against source rather than `dist/` so the gate can run
 * before a build:
 *
 *   - every directory under `src/docs/` is a section the registry declares,
 *     and every declared section has a directory;
 *   - the directory data file beside the pages carries the binding, so a page
 *     added later belongs because of where it lives rather than because someone
 *     remembered a frontmatter line;
 *   - every page declares a unique reading position, because a section is read
 *     in a sequence somebody chose;
 *   - a Markdown page opens with prose before its first `##`, saying what the
 *     reader will be able to do;
 *   - no link text is a hand-off phrase.
 *
 * The last two are asked of Markdown pages only. Get Started and Contribute are
 * hand-built landing pages on `layouts/base.njk` carrying hero sections and
 * their own containers, so "the prose before the first heading" is not a thing
 * they have. They are still sections, still bound, and still ordered.
 *
 * A repository link is not banned and should not be. The test from
 * GDR-KI-WEBSITE-002 is whether it survives as a fact rather than as a
 * destination, and link text is the part of that a machine can judge: "the full
 * guide" names a destination, while "the installer published at v0.4.0" names a
 * fact. Provenance is `verify-provenance.ts`; this file owns voice.
