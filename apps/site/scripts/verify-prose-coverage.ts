/**
 * Verifies that every element the prose pipeline emits is actually styled.
 *
 * `.prose-ki` styled `h2`, `h3`, `p`, `ul` and `li`. The Markdown corpus emits
 * far more: fifty tables across thirty-four of thirty-five published pages,
 * fifty-six `pre` blocks, and 1482 inline `code` elements. Those rendered as
 * browser defaults — a table with no padding, no borders and a shrink-to-fit
 * width — on the pages carrying the most material, and nothing reported it
 * because no rule was wrong. They were absent (KI-WEB-SITE-024).
 *
 * So this reads the selectors the stylesheet declares, walks the built output
 * for the elements that actually appear inside a `.prose-ki` container, and
 * fails on an element that no rule reaches. It fails rather than warns: unlike
 * upstream drift, an unstyled element is entirely within this site's control.
 *
 * An element counts as styled when a `.prose-ki` rule names it or when the
 * base layer gives it a deliberate element rule. That second route is why `a`
 * and `h1` need nothing here — `@layer base` already owns them.
 *
 * A `.prose-provenance` rule does not count. It refines the footer's table on
 * top of the `.prose-ki` base, so treating it as coverage would report the
 * body's tables as styled by a rule that never applies to them.
