/**
 * Vendors the `ki` command inventory out of the tool's own manual page.
 *
 * `/guidance/cli/` was 136 words and five links — the shortest page on the
 * site, and a reader who wanted to know what `ki` can do had to leave for a
 * repository to find out. Carrying that inventory in hand-written prose is the
 * wrong fix: eighty-four commands that change every release is exactly the
 * material that rotted the skill catalogue to 42 entries against an upstream
 * 61 with nothing noticing (KI-WEB-SITE-022).
 *
 * So the site consumes the published interface instead. `man/ki.1` is the
 * manual the CLI ships and installs; its COMMAND GROUPS section is a grouped
 * inventory with a purpose paragraph per group and a description per command,
 * and its SYNOPSIS lists the same commands more tersely. This parses both at an
 * immutable ref, reconciles them, and writes the result to
 * `src/_data/cliCommands.json5`.
 *
 * The snapshot is vendored rather than fetched during the build, for the same
 * reason the skill catalogue is: `apps/site/dist/` must be reproducible, and a
 * build that reached the network would depend on when it ran. Drift is caught
 * by the ordinary provenance sweep, because the page still declares `man/ki.1`
 * at this ref in its `sources`.
 *
 * Unlike the harness catalogue, roff carries no marker naming this block as a
 * published contract, so the parse asserts on structure it can check and
 * refuses anything it does not recognise rather than degrading quietly. The
 * durable fix is a machine-readable command projection from `tools-ki`; see
 * the handoff recorded against KI-WEB-SITE-022.
 *
 * Usage: bun scripts/sync-cli-commands.ts --ref <tag-or-commit>
 * See docs/guides/developer/guidance-provenance.md.
