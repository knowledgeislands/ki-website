  // Three entries, because the bar should say what the site is rather than list what it
  // contains. It previously carried six of very unequal weight: four opened a single page
  // while two opened thirty-seven between them, so a reader could not tell which links were
  // destinations and which were bodies of material (KI-WEB-SITE-037). Projects is reachable
  // from the Docs landing page and from the footer; it is a catalogue, not a section.
