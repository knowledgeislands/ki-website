# KI-WEB-BATCH-001 — Decide site-upload ownership

## Outcome authority

Deliver `KI-WEB-SITE-003` to a stable, evidence-backed disposition while keeping every Cloudflare remote action, Harness contract change, push, and release outside the run.

## Selected plan

1. `KI-WEB-SITE-003` — inspect the command's provenance and current callers, decide whether Website retains or removes it, verify the repository locally without invoking Wrangler, and return any retained-operation contract to `KI-HARNESS-GOV-007`.

This is a decision-and-documentation batch. Its mutable scope is limited to:

- `docs/roadmap/KI-WEB-SITE-003-decide-site-upload-ownership.md`
- `package.json` only if the command is rejected
- exact local documentation or CI references only if the command is rejected and those references exist
- `+/_AUTHORISATIONS/KI-WEB-BATCH-001.md`

Verification must remain local and non-mutating: build the site, run any existing tests, audit the declared engineering and Cloudflare skills, check authored Markdown, and confirm that no Wrangler upload or deployment command ran.

## Excluded work

- Any Wrangler upload, deployment, authentication, Cloudflare setting, or other remote-state action.
- Any edit to the Harness or its `ki-repo-website-cloudflare` contract.
- Any push, release, prune, or unrelated roadmap item.

## Completion and remedial policy

The admitted record must independently reach `awaiting-review`, pass its review-packet recheck, and close through `ki-accept`. Non-blocking improvements become separately prioritised follow-up records; they do not prevent a viable verified disposition from closing.

### `KI-WEB-SITE-003`

- **Admitted state and baseline:** `ready`; Website baseline `7be731fc987d87aea3e245b6ef163abaf07bf7b9`.
- **Result:** `done`; started by `8f33958`, delivered for review by `af89984`, and accepted by `6f7f074`.
- **Delivery evidence:** Introducing commit `64744124e036ebf90ebd78e387afbd994a1452f3`, current CI and documentation search, and official Cloudflare Versions and Deployments documentation establish a credible Workers Builds preview-upload purpose. The record returns the exact command and remote-effect safety boundary to `KI-HARNESS-GOV-007`.
- **Verification:** `bun run ki:site:build` and the `ki-engineering`, `ki-repo-website-cloudflare`, `ki-work-roadmap`, and `ki-authoring` audits passed. A manifest-only assertion checked the exact command without executing Wrangler. This repository has no `test` script.
- **Decision and stops:** Retained `ki:site:upload` as Website's intentional external-build hook and proposed Harness ownership. No Wrangler command, Cloudflare state change, public-contract edit, package change, push, release, or prune occurred. No delegation was used.

## Batch recap

The single admitted record reached `done` under the exact consolidated-acceptance grant. Website keeps the preview-upload command with a documented credentialed remote-mutation boundary; the Harness owns the separate contract decision. The run made no destructive or irreversible change, external coordination, deployment, push, release, or prune.
