/**
 * The dependency boundaries of the site workspace, enforced rather than described.
 *
 * `apps/site` has three layers with different lifetimes. The Eleventy build — `eleventy.config.ts` and the data
 * modules under `src/` — turns committed content into `dist/`. The commands under `scripts/` run around that build:
 * the `verify-*` gates check what it produced, and the `sync-*` commands refresh the vendored data it reads. The
 * helpers under `scripts/lib/` are what those commands share. Each rule below keeps one of those directions honest.
 *
 * The rules are cruised by `apps/site/src/boundaries.test.ts` through the install root at `tooling/boundaries`.
 * dependency-cruiser reads TypeScript through the compiler API and supports `typescript@>=2 <7`; against this
 * repository's TypeScript 7 it would read nothing at all, and an empty graph satisfies every rule here.
