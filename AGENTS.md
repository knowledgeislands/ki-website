# AGENTS.md — KI Website

Always-loaded orientation for an agent working in this repo, whichever runtime you are. The full picture is in [README.md](README.md); this file is the short anchor.

## What this repo is

The public-facing **Knowledge Islands** website — a static site built with the house web stack: **Eleventy 3 + Nunjucks + Markdown, TypeScript run natively on Bun, Tailwind 4 (config-less, semantic design tokens)** — compiled to a portable `dist/` that can be served from any root.

## Working here

- **The neutral website seam** follows `ki-repo-website`: the root exposes the `ki:site:build`, `ki:site:dev`, and `ki:site:clean` lifecycle and the site emits a reproducible `apps/site/dist/`.
- **The content implementation** follows `ki-repo-website-content` — the Eleventy/Nunjucks/Tailwind layout, the `src/_includes/{layouts,partials}/` structure, `tokens.css` design tokens, the portable-`dist/` URL transform, and SEO. Run `ki repo audit --skill ki-repo-website-content --repo .` before shipping a structural change.
- **The toolchain** (package.json scripts, `tsconfig`, `biome`) follows `ki-engineering`; `ki repo audit --skill ki-engineering --repo .` is the gate. The per-tool `ki:lint:*` script family was retired by `ADR-KI-HARNESS-TOOLCHAIN-001`; those checks now resolve through the native rubric, and `ki:deps:update` is the one script-seam exception.
- **Published guidance** restates material other repositories own, so every page declares its upstream `sources` in frontmatter and publishes them through `partials/sources.njk`. `verify:provenance` gates the declaration during `ki:site:build`; see [docs/guides/developer/page-provenance.md](docs/guides/developer/page-provenance.md).
- **Everything that teaches lives in a Docs section**, at `apps/site/src/docs/<section>/<page>.md`, bound by the directory data file beside it rather than by its own frontmatter and declared in `apps/site/src/_data/docsSections.json5`. `/projects/` is the catalogue of what exists, not where its guides live. `verify:docs` gates the shape — a unique reading position, an opening claim, and no link text that hands the reader off to a repository; see [docs/guides/developer/docs-sections.md](docs/guides/developer/docs-sections.md).
- **Markdown / TOML style** follows `ki-authoring`; `ki repo audit --skill ki-authoring --repo .` is the mechanical Markdown gate.
- **The repo shape** is a **monorepo** (`ki-engineering` §0): the root `package.json` declares `"workspaces": ["apps/*"]` and the site lives in the canonical `apps/site` workspace (`apps/site/eleventy.config.ts`, `apps/site/src/`, `apps/site/tsconfig.json`). The generated output is `apps/site/dist/`; root site scripts carry the `ki:site:` prefix and delegate through Turborepo, which owns the task graph (`turbo.json`).
- **Hosting** follows `ki-repo-website-cloudflare` (Workers Static Assets serving `apps/site/dist/`); `wrangler.jsonc` lives in `apps/site/` (`assets.directory: "dist"`), and the `ki:site:deploy` / `ki:site:preview` / `ki:site:clean` scripts are the entry points.
- **A bulk rewrite never touches `docs/roadmap/`.** A `sed` run across tracked files — a URL map, a filename rename, any of them — also rewrites what `docs/decisions/` and `docs/roadmap/` quote, and those are historical statements of what an address or a filename was at the time. Rewriting them falsifies the record rather than updating it: a rename sweep once left `KI-WEB-SITE-031` arguing in its own Context that `what-to-publish.md` should be renamed to `what-to-publish.md`. Decision records are living present-state documents and do want repointing; roadmap records do not. Scope the file list deliberately, and read `git diff --stat -- docs/` before staging.

## Toolchain

[Bun](https://bun.sh) for install/dev.

```bash
bun install         # install deps and wire the husky pre-commit hook
bun run ki:site:dev    # Tailwind watch + Eleventy serve on http://localhost:3000
bun run ki:site:build  # compile the site to dist/
ki repo audit --skill ki-engineering --repo .  # toolchain gate: Biome, TypeScript, scripts
ki repo audit --skill ki-authoring --repo .  # rumdl check for authored Markdown
bun run --cwd apps/site verify:provenance -- --network  # report published pages whose upstream has moved
```

## Progress and commits

- Give concise progress updates at meaningful checkpoints and at least every few minutes during sustained work.
- Commit only a completed, verified unit of work. Stage explicit paths for that unit and do not combine it with unrelated working-tree changes.
- If a unit cannot yet be verified, report the checkpoint and leave it uncommitted until its verification is complete.

## Cross-repository choreography

- Arcadia Principal, the KI Agentic Harness, `tools-ki`, KI Specifications, and the KI Website may add a concrete handoff item to one another's Stream or roadmap. The receiving repository owns its priority, plan, and execution.
- Record the originating repository and item, then state whether the handoff `blocks` or is `blocked by` the local item. Keep the relationship reciprocal where both items exist.
- Prefer independently executable, non-blocking work. Mark an item as blocking only when it is a genuine prerequisite; otherwise let the receiving repository schedule it in its own horizon.
