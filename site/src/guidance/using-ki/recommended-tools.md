# Optional tools

Optional user- and system-level tools that affect a person's machine rather than a governed repository. Skills, MCP servers, and day-to-day sessions can benefit from them, but none is required merely to read or audit the harness. [Install and get started](/guidance/using-ki/getting-started/) explains `ki bootstrap`, explicit skill activation, and when optional user-environment setup is appropriate.

## chezmoi (dotfile and machine-config management)

[chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io) manages the dotfiles and machine-level config this guide references — the per-repo `CLAUDE.md` imports, the `headroom-ai` and `mcporter` LaunchAgent plists, and the harness-mode notes chezmoi templates into `CLAUDE.md`. Machine-specific state (which `headroom-ai` mode is active, OAuth client secrets resolved from 1Password) is chezmoi-templated rather than hand-edited, so `chezmoi diff` / `chezmoi apply` is the way to pick up drift rather than editing the rendered files directly.

```bash
brew install chezmoi
chezmoi init <your-dotfiles-repo>
chezmoi apply
```

### Quick reference: re-add a Claude Desktop configuration

Use this only to bring an app-edited configuration back into chezmoi source state. Quit Claude Desktop first. The KI-managed MCP server list belongs in its canonical source, not in the rendered Desktop file.

```bash
chezmoi re-add --dry-run "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
chezmoi re-add "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
chezmoi diff
chezmoi apply -v
```

`re-add` preserves an existing chezmoi template; review `chezmoi diff` before applying. Use this path for settings outside the template-owned MCP server block.

## headroom-ai

headroom-ai provides context compaction management (`PreCompact` hook) and shell-output compression via its bundled RTK component.

```bash
brew install headroom-ai
```

headroom-ai runs in one of two modes:

- **Proxy mode** — `headroom proxy` starts a local proxy on port 8787; Claude Code is pointed at it via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787`.
- **Wrap mode** — `headroom claude` wraps the Claude CLI directly without a separate proxy process.

The harness CLAUDE.md notes which mode is active in the current machine's chezmoi config.

### Coverage by runtime

Headroom is not a machine-wide or generic desktop-application proxy.

Treat an agent as covered only when its model requests appear in Headroom's proxy statistics or logs.

An installed Headroom MCP server, a running local proxy, or a healthy `/health` response does not establish model-traffic coverage.

| Runtime                      | Current model-traffic coverage | Evidence                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code                  | Routed once configured         | Proxy statistics or logs                |
| Claude Desktop               | Direct — not covered           | No desktop proxy route                  |
| ChatGPT / Codex Desktop      | Direct — not covered           | No active proxy route                   |
| Other API-compatible clients | Conditional                    | Explicit proxy or wrapper configuration |

Claude Code is the supported, measured path: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` or the Headroom wrapper points its CLI at the local proxy.

Claude Desktop's subscription-backed traffic is not routed by the CLI integration.

Its MCP configuration is separate and does not proxy chat traffic.

The formerly managed ChatGPT/Codex proxy route is intentionally disabled until a supported path proves reliable telemetry and meaningful savings.

Verify every other client separately; coverage never carries over from another runtime.

Check a claimed route with `headroom perf --hours 1 --format json` or the local `/stats` endpoint, and confirm the relevant client appears in the result before relying on it for token savings.

## Codex skill discovery and experiments

The `skills` command-line tool can install third-party skills into a user's Codex skill directory. These are personal, user-scope additions: they do not become part of a governed repository or alter its declared KI skill set. Review a skill's source and behaviour before adding it, especially if it installs hooks or changes agent instructions.

### Caveman in Codex

[Caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) is an optional agent-local response-compression skill, not a model-traffic proxy or a KI harness dependency.

Use it as a narrow Codex trial first:

```bash
npx skills add JuliusBrussee/caveman -a codex
```

Start a new Codex session after installation, then activate it explicitly with `/caveman lite` for ordinary work.

Use `/caveman full` only when terse output remains clear for the task.

Use `normal mode` or `stop caveman` to return to normal output.

The documented integration is Codex CLI.

For ChatGPT or Codex Desktop, treat availability in a fresh session as an acceptance test rather than assuming the installed Codex skill transfers to that surface.

Keep Headroom as the only request proxy.

Caveman does not route model requests through Headroom, and it cannot make ChatGPT or Codex Desktop traffic appear in Headroom's coverage.

Continue to prove a Headroom route with its proxy statistics or logs as described in [Coverage by runtime](#coverage-by-runtime).

Do not add a Caveman-to-Headroom proxy chain, `caveman-shrink`, Cavemem, or Caveman Code as part of this trial.

No chezmoi change is required for an individual trial.

If the skill proves useful enough to standardise across machines, add a narrow, reviewable chezmoi profile with an explicit version, target runtime, and removal path; do not capture generated Codex state or install it for every runtime.

To add the `find-skills` discovery skill:

```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/skills@find-skills
```

Start a new Codex turn after installation so the newly installed skills are available for selection.

## Future tooling under observation

These are research leads, not harness dependencies or recommendations. Before adopting any candidate, assess its supply-chain provenance, permission model, runtime fit, maintenance, and claimed token or cost effects in a contained evaluation.

The current watch areas are model routing and identity, MCP aggregation and discovery, context compression, and multi-runtime harnesses or working methods.

The list records where future evaluation can begin. It does not establish that a project is secure, active, compatible, or suitable for Knowledge Islands use.

## mcporter (MCP proxy daemon)

mcporter consolidates all KI-owned MCP servers behind a single keep-alive daemon and exposes them through a single HTTP MCP endpoint, reducing the `~/.claude.json` `mcpServers` block from many stdio entries to one URL entry.

```bash
brew install steipete/tap/mcporter
```

Two LaunchAgents are deployed and activated by chezmoi:

| LaunchAgent label         | Command                              | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `sh.mcporter.daemon`      | `mcporter daemon start --foreground` | Keep-alive process manager for all servers       |
| `sh.mcporter.http-bridge` | `mcporter serve --http 3333`         | HTTP MCP endpoint at `http://localhost:3333/mcp` |

mcporter's config lives at `~/.mcporter/mcporter.json` (chezmoi-managed). It embeds full server definitions with `"lifecycle": "keep-alive"` for each server, resolved from the same `mcp-servers-json` chezmoi template that generates the Claude Desktop config.

After `chezmoi apply` loads the plists, activate them:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/sh.mcporter.daemon.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/sh.mcporter.http-bridge.plist
```

Tools are exposed as `server__tool` (double underscore). `~/.claude.json` should contain only a single `ki-mcporter` URL entry under `mcpServers`:

```json
"ki-mcporter": { "type": "url", "url": "http://localhost:3333/mcp" }
```

Verify with:

```bash
mcporter daemon status          # all servers idle/running
curl http://localhost:3333/mcp  # should return a valid MCP JSON response
```

Both mcporter's `config add` and Claude Code's own `claude mcp add` only accept `http` / `sse` / `stdio` transports — a server that speaks raw WebSocket only (no HTTP/SSE/stdio front end) cannot be registered through either, mcporter included. It is not a universal bridge between transports; confirm a candidate server's transport before assuming mcporter can front it.

## claude.ai connectors — the managed alternative

For a third-party SaaS integration (GitHub, Linear, Slack, Notion, the Google and Microsoft suites, and the like) there are two ways to get its tools into a session, and a local MCP server is only one of them. The other is a **claude.ai managed connector**, authorised once in claude.ai connector settings. Given this setup, the managed route is often the lower-friction one: Anthropic handles the OAuth, so there is no local OAuth flow to complete, no keep-alive daemon or secrets on the machine, and it works on surfaces where an interactive OAuth flow cannot run (a non-interactive Claude Code session, for instance, cannot complete one — it can only use a connector that is already authorised). Managed-connector schemas load on the claude.ai web / Desktop surface, where you toggle them per-conversation in the compose-bar tools menu, rather than into the Claude Code local surface.

Which route to prefer, per integration:

| Prefer                  | When                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **claude.ai connector** | A hosted connector exists and you mainly use that integration on claude.ai web / Desktop — least setup, no local OAuth. |
| **Local MCP server**    | You need it in the Claude Code CLI, need tools no connector offers, or need a KI server's own access gate + audit log † |

† The KI-owned `mcp-*` servers (workspace MCPs with the annotation-driven access-level gate and audit logging) are always the local route — there is no managed equivalent.

Do not wire the same integration **both** ways on the same surface — that loads two copies of its tool schemas. `ki-binding` governs which surface runs which server from the single `mcps.yaml` source and audits that the surfaces agree; see [Tuning](/guidance/using-ki/tuning/) for the leanness view of the same choice.

## VS Code command-execution MCP servers — evaluate before installing

A recurring want on this surface: letting the agent trigger a VS Code command directly (e.g. "Developer: Reload Web Views" after a session `/rename`, since the extension does not refresh its own UI on rename). Community MCP servers exist that expose `vscode.commands.executeCommand()` as a callable tool — for example `louisfghbvc/mcp-vscode-commands`. Before adopting one, check two things: whether it ships a signed `.vsix`/verified publisher (unsigned third-party extensions granting arbitrary command execution over an unauthenticated local socket are a real trust boundary, not a formality), and which transport it speaks — Claude Code's `claude mcp add` and mcporter's `config add` both only accept `http` / `sse` / `stdio`, so a WebSocket-only server (as `mcp-vscode-commands` currently is) cannot be wired into either regardless of how it is packaged. No such server is currently adopted here; this is a note for the next time the want resurfaces, not a recommendation.
